# ai2api
Yet another AI model training, fine-tuning, active learning &amp; deployment tool, but simpler &amp; open source

**Note:** Right now, what you see is a very simple implementation. The goal is to have a software that would automatically generate AI model inference API project using frameworks like Fast API/Flask/Django. Somewhat similar to what hugging face does already, but complete control to end-user on API project.
